# Weather-App
 An iOS application that displays real-time temperature and weather-cast for a requested area. 
 This application implements protocols, the Delegate Design pattern, closures, extensions, and computed properites. 
 I used the openweathermap REST API to make HTTP requests with URLSession to retrieve real-time data, parsing the JSON, about the weather.
