# Weather-App
An iOS application that displays real-time temperature and weather-cast for a requested area. 
This application implements protocols, the Delegate Design pattern, closures, extensions, and computed properites to efficiently create a full functioning iOS application. 
The RESTful API I used to retrieve real-time data regarding the weather was OpenWeatherMap.
