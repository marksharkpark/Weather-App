# Weather-App
An iOS app that shows the current temperature and weather forecast for a certain location. To effectively construct a fully functional iOS application, this app uses protocols, the Delegate Design pattern, closures, extensions, and computed properties. OpenWeatherMap was the RESTful API that I utilized to retrieve real-time weather data.
