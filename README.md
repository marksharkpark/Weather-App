# Weather-App
 An iOS app that will display the weather for a specific location. 
 This application uses Swift protocols, the Delegate Design pattern, closures, extensions, and computed properites. 
 I also used APIs to make HTTP requests with URLSession. 
 To parse the JSON, I used the native JSONDecoder.
 Retrieving GPS data by using Core Location.
